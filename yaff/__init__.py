'''YAFF - Yet another force field

   The ``yaff`` package contains the subpackages that define the main
   functionalities in yaff: force field models (:mod:`yaff.pes`), sampling
   (:mod:`yaff.sampling`), trajectory analysis (:mod:`yaff.analysis`) and
   parameter tuning (:mod:`yaff.tune`). These major subpackages are discusses in
   the following sections.
