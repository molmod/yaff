Installation
############


Disclaimer
==========

Yaff is developed and tested on modern Linux environments. The
installation instructions below are given for a Linux system only. If you want
to use Yaff on other operating systems such as Windows or OSX, you should
have a minimal computer geek status to get it working. We are always interested
in hearing from your installation adventures.


MolMod dependency
=================

`MolMod <http://molmod.github.com/molmod/>`_ is a Python library used by most
Python programs developed at the CMM. It must be installed before Yaff can
be used or installed. Installation and download instructions can be found in the
`molmod documentation <http://molmod.github.com/molmod/tutorial/install.html>`_.
The instructions below only work if the MolMod package is installed.
